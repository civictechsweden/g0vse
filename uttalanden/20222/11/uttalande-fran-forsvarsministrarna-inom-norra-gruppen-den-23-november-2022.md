## Joint Statement by the Ministers of Defence of the Northern Group

Today, representatives of the Northern Group – comprising Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom - met in Oslo on board the UK aircraft carrier, HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH, and gave the following statement:

Today we discussed the implications of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s invasion continues to inflict immeasurable destruction and suffering on the Ukrainian people, and is a threat to the security of the whole of Europe and the North Atlantic area. We stand together with Ukraine and remain committed in our support against Russia’s brutal and illegal aggression.

Today we also discussed the security developments in Northern Europe, including the Baltic Sea and the High North. We underline our strong political unity and cohesion in the face of threats to our region. We will continue our collaboration with regard to securing critical infrastructure in and between our respective countries. We remain steadfast in our common efforts to stand up against and counter Russian malign activities and threats, and their potential impacts on European security.

As our respective nations have all ratified the Finnish and Swedish application for NATO membership, we stand by and support both countries throughout the transition period. We look forward to welcoming Finland and Sweden as Allies. This will strengthen our collective security and enhance stability in the Northern Europe and the Alliance as a whole.

# Uttalande av Sverige på Säkerhetsrådets möte om Nordkorea

National Statement delivered on behalf of Sweden at the Security Council Briefing on DPRK on Monday, 04 September 2017\.


(As delivered)

Thank you, Mr President, and thank you Mr Feltman for your briefing.

Only days since we last met to discuss the DPRK, we once again find ourselves called together to respond to the provocative actions of Pyongyang.

Sweden condemns, in the strongest possible terms, yesterday’s nuclear test. It constitutes a clear threat to international peace and security, an unacceptable provocation and a clear breach of the DPRK’s international obligations, in defiance of numerous Security Council Resolutions. The DPRK’s dangerous and destabilising course of action further exacerbates the precarious humanitarian situation; another example of the regime’s determination to pursue its nuclear ambitions with an utter disregard for the wellbeing of its own people.

 This latest action further raises the already heightened tensions in the region as a result of the DPRK’s actions in recent months. The potential for mistakes, misunderstandings and miscalculations is high. There is a pressing need for measures to reduce tensions in the region and to consider how this Council can facilitate a comprehensive solution to the situation.

 We renew our call on the DPRK to abandon the dangerous path it is pursuing, to comply with its international obligations and to take positive steps in line with the Comprehensive Nuclear\-Test\-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non\-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).

Mr President,

The Council must deliver a firm response and remain united in the face of the threat to peace that the DPRK’s actions constitute – non only to its neighbours and the region – but to global non\-proliferation at large. We are ready to explore new sanctions.

 However, sanctions must be duly implemented to have the desired effect. This is also a matter of credibility for the UN system. All countries have a duty to effectively implement the relevant sanctions in line with relevant Security Council Resolutions. Yet, the implementation of the sanctions against the DPRK remains insufficient and highly inconsistent. All UN member states must do their utmost in this regard. The Council should make full use of the tools at its disposal. In this context, we look forward to the briefing on the 1718 Committee on 11 September and discussion of further measures to strengthen the implementation of sanctions in force.

Mr President,

At the same time, sanctions alone will not solve the situation on the Korean peninsula. And there is no military solution to the tense situation.

In light of the continuous growth in tensions, there is an urgent need to avoid escalation, and to take steps to prepare for a peaceful, diplomatic and comprehensive solution to the situation. Intensified and creative diplomatic efforts are urgently needed. A regional security mechanism should be a medium\-term goal.

The pursuit of weapons of mass destruction represents one of the gravest threats to international peace and security. Preventing their development and use is a crucial responsibility of this Council. Sweden stands united with Council members in condemning actions that jeopardise international peace and security.

 Thank you.

Irina Schoulgin Nyoni, Ambassador, Deputy Permanent Representative

# Joint statement from the Nordic-Baltic leaders

Nordic-Baltic leaders’ statement (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, 14 February 2025).

We stand fully and firmly behind Ukraine. Ukraine must be able to prevail against Russia’s war of aggression, to ensure a just and lasting peace. The outcome of the war will have fundamental and long-lasting effects on European and transatlantic security.

Our priority now is to strengthen Ukraine. Our countries are some of the largest per-capita contributors of military assistance to Ukraine. We will further bolster our support.

We are engaging with Ukraine, the United States and all our NATO Allies and EU partners on how to achieve peace through strength. We fully commit to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Ukraine should be given strong security guarantees. Ukraine and Europe must be involved in any negotiations to achieve just and lasting peace.

We are investing strongly in our own defence. We are determined to further strengthen our collective security and defence, and to shoulder our responsibility for peace and security in Europe.

# Pressuttalande av ordförande i FN:s säkerhetsråd efter diskussioner om Syrien i Backåkra den 22 april 2018

Press elements by the President of the Security Council following discussions on Syria at the retreat at Backåkra, Sweden, on 22 April 2018\.


We had an open and in\-depth exchange of views on Syria together with the Secretary\-General and his special envoy Staffan de Mistura this morning.

We all agreed that it is time to recreate and strengthen dialogue, and find a constructive dynamic in the Council. Today was a step in that direction.

There is need to reinvigorate the UN\-led political process. We reaffirmed commitment to UN efforts. Only the UN has the legitimacy and credibility needed for a viable, enduring political solution. A political solution needs to be in line with resolution 2254\.

We agreed on the need for full implementation of resolution 2401 that was adopted in February to address the humanitarian situation, and agreed to intensify efforts.

We also agreed that the use of chemical weapons is a violation of resolution 2118 and is unacceptable. We reaffirmed our commitment to establish an independent and impartial attribution mechanism, and in this regard agreed to engage in a dialogue with the support of the SG.

We welcome the Secretary\-General's commitment to engage with the Security Council on Syria. We must support and empower him in the use of his good offices. Consultations among the key stakeholders will be necessary.

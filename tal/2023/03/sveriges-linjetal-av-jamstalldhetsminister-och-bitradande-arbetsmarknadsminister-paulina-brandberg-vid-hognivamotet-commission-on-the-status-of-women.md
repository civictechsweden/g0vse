Det talade ordet gäller.


Madame Chair,

Excellencies, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is an honour for me to address the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. Sweden aligns itself with the statement made by Sweden on behalf of the EU, and its Member States.

Our thoughts today are with all women and girls living in conflict situations and other emergencies for example in Afghanistan and Iran and not least in Ukraine.

The impact on the civilian population within my region – I am now speaking about Ukraine – continues to be immense, and a huge number of people, amongst many of them are women and children, have been forced to flee their homes.

Let me be clear. We stand united in strong solidarity with the Ukrainian people. My government will continue to support Ukraine and hold Russia fully responsible. International humanitarian law must be respected.

\*\*\*

I am a proud member of the Swedish government which includes a gender equality perspective into all areas of policy\-making. The objective of Swedish gender equality policy is that women and men, boys and girls, shall have equal power to shape society and their own lives.

Because human rights are universal and apply to all, everyone must be able to fully enjoy their human rights, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation, age, or other status. The Swedish Government is committed to ensure equal rights and the full and equal enjoyment of human rights of LGBTQI\-persons.

\*\*\*

Internet and technology is still thought of as a man’s world. Stereotypical norms are common in online communities, in which the rhetoric attributed to women’s rights movement is often aggressive.

As policy makers meeting here at CSW, we have an obligation to make a change for current and future generations, ensuring that technology will equally serve and benefit both women and men, girls and boys, in all their diversity.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Stopping gender based violence should be a priority for all of us. We must protect and support victims of men’s violence against women and ‘honour’\-related violence and oppression as well as prostitution and human trafficking for sexual purposes. In my previous profession as a prosecutor, I have witnessed the heavy price being paid by the victims.

We can never accept that anyone is denied their rights to decide over their own lives and their own bodies. The blame must always be put where it belongs: on the perpetrators.

Combatting the digital dimensions of gender based violence will be of crucial importance to pave the way for gender equality in the digital age.

Boys and young men have a responsibility to combat all forms of gender\-based violence.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Our joint and multi\-lateral efforts must be intensified.

We must continue standing up for all women’s and girls’ full enjoyment of human rights, including their sexual and reproductive health and rights.

We must continue promoting access to safe and legal abortions, contraceptives, and comprehensive sexuality education.

Together we must continue to stand up for women, peace, and security.

Together we must take a gender\-transformative approach to innovation, technology, and digital education. Scientific progress must be gender\-equal at its core.

Sweden will continue to push for gender equality, women’s and girls’ empowerment and their full enjoyment of all human rights. In doing so we are building a more equal and resilient world. Let us join forces and build a better world and a better future in the interest for everyone.

I thank you!

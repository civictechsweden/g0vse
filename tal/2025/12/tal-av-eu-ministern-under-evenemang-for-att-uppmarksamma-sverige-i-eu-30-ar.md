# Tal av EU-ministern under evenemang för att uppmärksamma Sverige i EU 30 år

EU-minister Jessica Rosencrantz, Bryssel, den 17 november 2025.

Det talade ordet gäller.

Thank you to all the organisers for this great event. I am particularly glad to share the occasion of the 30-year anniversary with my Austrian and Finnish colleagues.

When Sweden took the step into the European Union 30 years ago, it was a historic decision, made with a narrow majority, but it confirmed what everyone already knew – that Sweden was an integral part of the free and democratic Europe. We’re bound by values, culture and economics. And we’re better as a nation and as a continent, when we work together.

Over the past three decades, Sweden has benefitted greatly from our membership. It has strengthened our economy through full access to the internal market, creating opportunities for trade, jobs and growth. Membership has also amplified Sweden’s voice in Europe, giving us real influence over decisions that shape our continent – and the world.

But it has perhaps never been as important to reflect on what we have in front of us.

We are in the midst of one of the greatest transformations of European politics and the European Union in a very long time.

It is driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, the political direction on the other side of the Atlantic and China’s ambition to shape a multipolar world.

The European project has seen a renewed purpose. Or rather, it is returning to its roots of peace and security. There is a near consensus that Europe has to take a greater responsibility for the security of our continent and to be equipped to respond to crises, conflicts and wars in our own neighbourhood.

And we have taken steps to improve our collective defence and strengthen our defence industrial base – steps that I do not believe would have been possible just a few years ago. Going forward, I am convinced that the EU will play an increasingly important role in enabling defence investment and rearmament.

The Swedish Government is taking our part of that shared responsibility, with the biggest investments in our total defence since the Cold War.

Strengthened and continued support for Ukraine is central for the Swedish government. We will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.

Because we are witnessing a struggle between good and evil. Supporting Ukraine is our duty as Europeans and citizens of the free world. Ukraine’s victory is our victory. Their defeat is our defeat.

The EU has now overtaken the United States as the largest donor of assistance to Ukraine, including military aid. Sweden, together with our close allies in the Nordic and Baltic countries, is among those who give the most. Since February 2022, Sweden has contributed the equivalent of approximately EUR 9 billion to support Ukraine.

We are proud of that – but more countries can do more. Ukraine’s financial and military needs are immense, and they are here and now. Countries must step up and we need to make full use of the frozen Russian central bank assets - to support Ukraine and to make Russia pay for the damage they have caused. And we need a decision on this at the European Council in December.

The war in Ukraine has also made it clear that enlargement is a geopolitical necessity.

It is our main tool for securing prosperity and stability in Europe. And if the European Union does not provide a credible path to membership, other actors will step in and fill that void.

Ukraine submitted its membership application just days after the war began in 2022. It was signed from a bunker, with missiles raining down on the city outside. That says something about what the European Union means for Ukraine.

Shortly after Ukraine had submitted its official application, Moldova followed. Already in the process are the countries on the Western Balkans, with different levels of progress and political commitment, I shall add.

There is a broad consensus in our council meetings that we need enlargement. Because Ukraine, Moldova and the countries on the Western Balkans belong in the European Union.

The process of joining our Union is rigid. Our standards and expectations are high on those seeking to become members. We are not only a Union by geography – we are a union of values.

As such, safeguarding the rule of law and defending our shared values within the Union are at the core of what our union is about.

And we have plenty of problems, all over Europe. Not least when it comes to corruption, media independence and journalistic freedom. The most obvious case is Hungary, where the situation, unfortunately, has been deteriorating for a long time.

Let me be very clear: the Swedish government is at the forefront of defending democracy, the rule of law and equal rights.

And we are using all available instruments to do so. In the newly presented long-term budget, the Commission has introduced an even stronger link between EU funding and respect for the rule of law. Something not least Sweden and Finland have been pushing for. Because sometimes money is the only language everyone understands.

Let me finally say a few words about two other crucial issues for Europe and for Sweden: namely our agenda to fight climate change and our agenda for increased competitiveness and growth.

I’m convinced that these two issues are entirely interlinked. You can’t have one without the other. A competitive green transition drives growth, and vice versa.

We must make sure that Europe is fit for the new age. That we are attractive in the eyes of global companies seeking to invest.

We need to stick to our goals on climate and create predictability for our businesses. At the same time, we need to make sure we have a real single market, functioning and effective capital markets in Europe and a reduced  regulatory burden.

Some people are very gloomy about Europe, when it comes to competition with US and China. But we know what we need to do. This is our chance to either do what’s necessary and be rewarded for it – or sit on our hands and become the world’s biggest museum of yesterday’s innovations.

We are already acting on it. Now we need to speed up the process and take bold decisions. Thank you.

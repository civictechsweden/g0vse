# Statsministerns tal på Join Sweden Summit

Statsministerns tal på Join Sweden Summit i Stockholm, den 19 februari 2025.

Det talade ordet gäller.

Your Royal Highness,

Ladies and gentlemen,

Sweden knows from historic lessons that no country can take prosperity for granted.

In 1870 we were one of the poorest countries in Europe. 100 years later we were one of the richest in the world. Ever since we know that everything is possible, but nothing is for free. It has never been.

Nowadays, global competition is increasing, in all fields. This obviously means challenges. Not least for a small country in the northern outskirts of Europe. But we’ve also learnt that challenges mean opportunities to become more innovative, more entrepreneurial, more efficient and even faster. And we try to make the most out of it.

In fact, we are so focused on competitiveness, that we put it on top of the agenda during our EU presidency two years ago. And now, when also the European Commission is intensifying its efforts, there is a true momentum.

Competitiveness and a growing economy have always been critical for the success of the Nordic Model. Parliament and Government know it. The business community knows it. Labour unions know it.

Obviously, unions and employers sometimes disagree – that’s natural. But in Sweden they also unite in the insight that only competitive companies provide sustainable jobs. That only well-educated employees see new technology as a new chance, and not a threat. And that only access to re-skilling and up-skilling bring openness to industrial and corporate change.

As a result – we happen to have substantially fewer strike days compared to many other countries. Basically we have jointly built this country not as rivals but as partners.

\*\*\*

For more than 150 years we’ve been proud of Swedish inventions, inventors and entrepreneurs. From SKF’s ball bearings and Ericsson’s switchboards at the turn of the last century, to Klarna and Spotify in the beginning of this millennium.

Basically four factors have been decisive for Sweden’s innovation success.

First, education for all – not for the few.

Second, making the most of technology transformations such as industrialization, electrification and digitalisation.

Third, deregulation, free markets and free trade – as you know, we don’t believe in tariffs, not even those who would protect our businesses.

And last but not least: understanding that to build great and growing companies you need to be able to successfully compete globally.

That’s why innovation and constant progression became a national virtue. And I do believe we’ve kept that spirit. We rank as one of the most innovative countries in the world, whatever ranking you might prefer. It always stems out of people – but one important reason is that our collective R&D spending amounts to more than 3,5 percent of GDP.

\*\*\*

Sweden being quite small makes domestic ties even stronger. People here don’t move between politics and business to the same degree as in other countries, but government and the corporate sector have a century old tradition of close cooperation.

Since 1980, many Swedes know the phrase “staten och kapitalet” – state and capital – as a great rock cover of its time, still being played. But it is actually much more than that. It is basically our recipe for success.

But don’t get me wrong – we don’t subsidise, and we don’t pick winners. Instead we create good preconditions. In terms of primary and secondary education. In terms of research and higher education. In terms of trust, in our robust institutions – and in each other.

\*\*\*

And more than that: We know that taxes affect incentives for employers and employees. That’s why we cut the top margin taxation. That’s why we expand the expert tax relief. And that’s why we improve the conditions for individual investment savings accounts.

Right now, our tax ratio to GDP is the lowest since 1975.

\*\*\*

There might be a few Financial Times readers here today. Perhaps some of you remember the article – and I quote – “How Sweden’s stock market became the envy of Europe”.

Over the past 10 years, more companies made an IPO in Sweden, than in France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands – combined.

Swedes normally don’t brag – but it is worth mentioning that we’ve managed to do this while keeping our country financially sound. Fiscal discipline and economic stability are also good preconditions for our investment climate.

\*\*\*

On climate, for us the ongoing green transition is not a burden. Quite the opposite, it’s an opportunity. And we intend to use that momentum.

In this country we have vast amounts of resources. From forests and waterfalls to metals and minerals enabling new technology. Our electricity supply is close to 100 percent fossil free. When Swedish products go on export, it benefits both global climate action – and our own society.

In Sweden there is a complete unity in Parliament on our national climate commitments under EU legislation. That is close to unique in Europe. As is the fact that we are united in our bipartisan support for the EU membership.

We also agree we need more clean electricity. And now this Government is paving the way for that, short-term as well as long-term. We are taking big steps for scaling up our nuclear energy capacity, while also enabling more wind and solar power. Basically, more of everything that’s fossil free.

\*\*\*

Clean and reliable energy is key, but so is fast and predictable permitting processes. As Swedes we have a habit to do things by the book. It is a virtue, but we shouldn’t overdo it.

We shouldn’t make the book as thick and complicated as possible. That’s also what companies have been telling us for quite some time. And we listen. We now make it substantially quicker and easier, under one single rulebook and one authority.

But we also want feedback: when you encounter hurdles, tell us. We have the dialogue with businesses because at the end of the day we have the same goal.

\*\*\*

To make Sweden more prosperous is at the core of our ambitions. But in these geopolitical times of war, hostilities and tensions abroad, and organised crime at home, we also make Sweden safer.

Sweden has as you know joined Nato after 200 years of non-alignment, and no security policy task is for us more important than supporting Ukraine. Because Ukraine is fighting not only for their freedom, but also for all Western democracies.

Domestically, we are rolling out a carpet of legislation, combatting violent and organised crime. So that law-abiding citizens and companies can feel safe again.

\*\*\*

Ladies and gentlemen: In this age of uncertainty, we want to provide hope and stability. You need to take all the problems seriously. But you also need to see the potential to build something better!

So: We intend to remain an open-minded country. Open for trade, open for new ideas, open for skilled labor – and open for business. This summit invites you to join us – to make us even better – and to become part of the great Team Sweden.

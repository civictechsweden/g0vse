Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear colleagues,

I would like to thank the government of Qatar for hosting this highly important meeting and for your hospitality. You have shown important leadership in bringing us together and encouraged us all to seize this opportunity to re-center social issues.

Today, multiple and interlinked crises – be it democratic backsliding, reduced rights for LGBTQI-persons and repeated human rights violations – continue to affect the lives of millions across the globe. Right now, it's more important than ever for countries to work together.

Sweden reaffirms its strong commitment to social development, rooted in equality and gender equality, which are powerful drivers of inclusive and sustainable growth. This year marks 30 years since the adoption of the Copenhagen Declaration. A significant milestone in our shared commitment to social development.

While we welcome the progress made, we must also acknowledge that progress has been slow and major gaps remain. The three core themes: elimination of poverty, full and productive employment with decent work for all, and social integration – are deeply interrelated and mutually reinforcing.

As Sweden's Minister for Social Services, I am responsible for the rights of the child, social inclusion, and the rights of persons with disabilities – areas that are close to my heart and central to our national efforts.

Let me highlight a few initiatives that reflect Sweden’s commitment to strengthening the rights of the child, inclusion, and cohesion:

Sweden has adopted the most significant social policy reform in decades – a major revision of the Social Services Act. This new legislation emphasizes preventive work and early intervention, aiming to support families and individuals before social issues escalates.

The Government are also continuously investing in children and the fulfillment of rights of the child. Parental support is a key tool in preventing placements into alternative care. We are expanding accessible and applicable parental support measures and strengthening mental health services for young people.

We are also working hard to ensure an accessible society for all. Using the UNCRPD as a starting point – a new national action plan on disability policy is under development.

Sweden believes that employment is one of the most effective pathways out of poverty. Work provides not only income, but dignity, empowerment, and a sense of belonging. That is why we are committed to restoring a strong employment-first approach, ensuring that more people are included in the labour market and contribute to society.

Beyond national efforts, Sweden remains a strong advocate for social development globally. Through our international development cooperation, we support initiatives that strengthen social protection systems, promote decent work, advance gender equality and increase access to sexual and reproductive health and rights services for all in partner countries.

We actively engage in multilateral forums to promote inclusive policies and to promote and protect the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for all persons, not least those in  the most vulnerable situations.

I would also like to express our deep appreciation for the work of civil society organizations, whose tireless efforts are essential in promoting social inclusion and development.

Thank you for your attention!

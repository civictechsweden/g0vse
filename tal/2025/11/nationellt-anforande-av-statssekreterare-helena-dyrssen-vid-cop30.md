Det talade ordet gäller.

Excellencies,

Colleagues,

As we all know, the impacts of climate change are increasingly evident across the globe. It is up to us to respond.

This year’s NDCs provide an excellent platform for that response. Taken together, they show us how far we have come in limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. They also show us that we collectively need to do more – primarily the G20 countries, which account for 80 percent of global emissions.

From a Swedish perspective, we believe the NDCs also provide a platform for development pathways, highlighting the solutions we will deploy not only to limit temperature rise and strengthen resilience, but also to build growing economies for the future.

The Swedish message has consistently been urgency and opportunity – urgency based on what science tells us, opportunity based on the economic growth, jobs and strengthened competitiveness that the climate transition brings.

Sweden has reduced its emissions by 33 percent since 1990, while at the same time having grown its GDP per capita by 58 percent. For Sweden, climate action and strengthened competitiveness go hand in hand.

I am proud to see the engagement from Swedish business actors, and the innovative solutions they bring to the table. Now, it is up to all of us to put in place policies that stimulate demand for the solutions we know are available. And we can set the bar high, because science is clear: The solutions exist and are within our reach.

Sweden has a long and proud history of innovation. From being a poor, agricultural society, Sweden grew into one of the world’s most competitive and forward-thinking economies.

It is also on that basis Swedish climate diplomacy is built, around the three pillars of policy, finance and technology.

We work with partners to advance ambitious climate policies under the Paris Agreement, including carbon pricing. Businesses consistently call for this measure, which is not only an effective tool for reducing emissions but also a source of revenue.

Also, I want to highlight sustainable circular bioeconomy in mitigation by substituting fossil-based options in other sectors. It boosts local and regional livelihoods, as well as security of supply. Let me also underline the importance of gender equality for effective climate action.

For the second pillar – finance - we encourage the mobilisation of finance by embedding climate action within national budget and planning processes, integrating it across development finance, and fostering an investment environment that attracts both domestic and international capital.

In 2024, Sweden’s international climate finance amounted to approximately 1.1 billion USD. This year, Sweden is also proud to serve as co-chair of the Green Climate Fund – working towards enhancing its efficiency and impact.

For the third pillar – technology – we highlight the solutions that in our case Swedish business actors can provide across all sectors to accelerate the transition to net-zero.

Allow me here to express my appreciation to India for our strong collaboration in the Leadership Group for Industry Transition - LeadIt - focusing on reducing emissions in sectors such as steel and cement.

Taken together, we believe the three pillars of our climate diplomacy provide a solid basis for collaboration with partners globally.

We will continue working with the Brazilian Presidency and all parties to ensure a negotiated outcome from COP30 that sets the direction for accelerating implementation of the NDCs. We call for a process within the UNFCCC that strengthens collaboration for implementing our NDCs, supporting us all in raising ambition to the level it needs to be.

We look forward to working with you all to harness the benefits of the green transition, seizing opportunities and responding to the urgency of the moment.

Thank you!

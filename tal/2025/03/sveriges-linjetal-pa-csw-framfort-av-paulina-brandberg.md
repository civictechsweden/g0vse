Sveriges linjetal framfört av jämställdhetsminister Paulina Brandberg vid högnivåmötet Commission on the Status of Women, New York, 12 mars 2025.

Det talade ordet gäller.

Excellencies, Distinguished delegates, Members of Civil Society.

Sweden aligns itself fully with the statement made earlier by the EU and the LGBTI Core Group.

This CSW session takes us all back to Beijing in 1995 when the e Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action was adopted.

Here we stand 30 years later, celebrating those who made it possible and honouring the transformative power of those global commitments for gender equality.

Change has not happened by itself. It has been through the determined efforts of progressive governments across the world, a strong civil society, not least women’s organisations, as well as the power of multilateralism.

I am happy to read about the progress made in the last five years highlighted in the report of the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres. It is important not to lose sight of this, in a world that is so beset by challenges: in spite of it all, the world is a better place for most women and girls today compared to 1995.

I say “most women and girls” because our thoughts today are with all those that are  left behind. Women and girls living in extreme poverty, in conflict situations, humanitarian crisis or under violence and oppression. No conflict or war is gender neutral.

Human rights must always be defended. International law applies to everyone, regardless of context. Those who stay silent, when faced with violence against women and children, cannot claim to stand up for human rights.

In my own region, Ukrainian women courageously defend their own country and all of Europe – as soldiers, humanitarians, entrepreneurs and political leaders.

At the same time, Russia uses sexual violence against women and girls of all ages, and a majority of those fleeing Russia’s aggression are women.

My government’s top foreign policy priority is to support Ukraine. This includes holding Russia accountable for its crimes in and against Ukraine. It also includes support to women’s economic empowerment, and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda.

When gender equality, women’s enjoyment of human rights and sexual and reproductive health and rights are under attack, I am proud that Sweden continues to stand up and push back.

On February 6 this year, my Prime Minister decided that the Government Offices of Sweden shall include a gender equality perspective into ALL areas of policy making 2025-2029.

The Swedish government is also currently preparing a proposal to introduce a provision on the right to abortion in the Constitution. By doing so it gives the right to abortion the status as a fundamental right.

In Sweden, we are also committed to stop the exploitation of individuals in prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes.

The Swedish Government is committed to ensure equal rights and opportunities, and the full enjoyment of human rights of LGBTIQ-persons. Human rights are universal and apply to all, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation, age, or other status.

Gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights are priorities for Sweden’s development assistance. Sweden contributes to increased access to maternal health services, legal and  safe abortion, comprehensive sexuality education and prevention of all forms of sexual and gender-based violence.

I am proud to say that 2025, Sweden holds the Presidency of the UN Women Executive Board. We will work with the board to advance global gender equality efforts. Sweden will particularly highlight the importance of women’s economic empowerment.

We need to defend the advancements already made on gender equality and keep pushing for progress. We also need to advance our position for groups in particularly vulnerable situations, such as women and girls with disabilities.

All forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and ‘honour’-based violence and oppression, must be eliminated.

Men and boys, in all their diversity, must engage in this work – as agents of change as well as beneficiaries of gender equality.

To conclude, Sweden will remain a strong voice and actor for gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment. We will continue to support global initiatives aimed at creating better living conditions for women and girls living in poverty and under oppression.

We will continue to support all women’s and girls’ full enjoyment of human rights. You can count on Sweden. Thank you for your attention!

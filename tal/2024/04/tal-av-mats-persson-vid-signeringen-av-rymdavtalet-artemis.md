Dear all,

Before signing the Artemis Accords, I would like to give some remarks.

Space is a global commons. We have a responsibility for our future generations to secure a fair and sustainable use of space, so that we all can share the benefits of space based infrastructures and services.

As the importance of those grows for vital applications on Earth, it is of utmost importance that we all contribute to a peaceful use of outer space.

Sweden is strongly committed to strengthening international security and safety in outer space and to preventing an arms race in outer space.

This is essential for safeguarding the long\-term use of the space environment for peaceful purposes.

Sweden believes that the establishment of non\-legally binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour in space can be a good and pragmatic way forward.

At the same time Sweden underlines the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, the UN Treaties on Outer Space and international humanitarian law to activities in outer space.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 remains the cornerstone of international space law and its key arms control provisions must be adhered to.

Sweden will therefore continue to be active in and contribute to the work in the UN Committee for Peaceful Use of Outer Space, which has a central role in the development of international law for the space domain.

The Artemis Accords are a set of non\-legally binding principles that describe a vision to create a safe and transparent environment which facilitates exploration, science, and commercial activities in space, grounded in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967\.

We have analyzed these principles and it is my pleasure to confirm that we, after careful consideration and consultation with stakeholders, have decided to join the Artemis Accords.

I would like to point out two parts of the Accords that, for me as the Minister of Education, are extra insightful.

The Artemis Accords emphasize the importance of sharing scientific data openly and transparently. The release of scientific data collected during space exploration missions to the public and the international scientific community.

This commitment to transparency aims to enhance collaboration and allowing for greater understanding and advancement of scientific knowledge about space and celestial bodies.

The agreement also emphasizes the preservation of historical and cultural sites, including those of significant scientific value, to ensure they are respected and safeguarded during space exploration \- particularly on celestial bodies like the Moon and other planetary surfaces.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our American partners in Washington D.C. and at the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm for the fruitful background explanations and discussions on a technical level that have taken place the last two years, as those contributed greatly to our understanding of the Artemis Accords and subsequently our decision to join.

Now, it is my pleasure to announce that I, on behalf of the Kingdom of Sweden, will sign the Artemis Accords, thus confirming Sweden’s commitment to the principles there within.

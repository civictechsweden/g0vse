President,

I extend my sincere gratitude to the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, the co-facilitators, and all stakeholders. Your efforts have been instrumental in arriving at this crucial moment.

I proud to speak to you today as a representative of the Swedish government and as a mother of two. Being able to say to my children that their rights are put at the very center of the Pact for the future.

The Pact of the future as agreed to today is a blueprint for a future where a rules-based international order, based on the UN charter, is stronger and more resilient. Where cooperation and multilateralism thrives.

Our world faces unprecedented and interconnected challenges; the highest number of conflicts since WWII, threats to human rights, democracy, and gender equality, not to mention climate change.

We are at the same time living in an era where digital and emerging technologies are reshaping every aspect of our lives. The digital revolution offers immense potential and hope on our path to a better future.

Sweden, alongside Zambia, has had the great privilege to lead our collective efforts in agreeing on a Global Digital Compact.

This is the roadmap to a digital future that is open, safe, secure, sustainable and inclusive - where opportunity knows no borders.

The Global Digital Compact will enable closing the digital divides and turbocharge the Sustainable Development Goals.

The GDC emphasizes environmental sustainability, the empowerment of women and girls - protecting human rights in the digital space.

A childhood in freedom requires safety online.

At the heart of this vision is the belief that technology, and particularly AI, must serve humanity.

Through the Global Digital Compact, we are advocating for key AI initiatives, including a Scientific Panel, a Global Dialogue on Governance,  and Capacity Building Fund.

These initiatives aim to ensure that AI serves humanity and upholds our shared values. This is the foundation we urgently need to secure a future where AI benefits everyone.

President,

The global needs are extensive, and the funding gap is growing. As one of the world's most generous donors, exceeding the UN’s target of 0.7 percent of Gross National Income to ODA, Sweden welcomes the ambition to increase the effectiveness and scale of innovative financing for the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement.

The reform of the international financial architecture is key. We must adapt to maintain legitimacy by ensuring fair representation and protecting the voices of the poorest and most vulnerable.

Also the Security Council must reflect today’s realities, including seats for African nations and fair representation for all.

President,

In times of strife and suffering—from Ukraine to Sudan, from the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to Gaza—Sweden stands as a pillar of support for peace and humanity. We will continue to stand tall in defense of international law, sovereignty, and the rights of all nations to live in peace.

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an attack on the very principles that uphold this organization. Our response must be clear and unwavering.

President,

We stand at a window of opportunity.

I want to step into the future where the light of justice and peace never dims. I want to fulfill the promises made to our children and generations to come.

Sweden is committed to walk this path with the UN, its Member States and all stakeholders.

Thank you.

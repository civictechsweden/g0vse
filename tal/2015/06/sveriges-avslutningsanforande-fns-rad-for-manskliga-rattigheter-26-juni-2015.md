Mr President,

Let me first of all thank you and all those who have participated today for a very helpful and valuable discussion. Many important issues were brought to our attention and will be considered in the follow up of the review. I am particularly grateful for the interventions by non-state stakeholders. The participation by stakeholders in the UPR process as well as the work of the Council in general is one of the true institutional strengths of this Council.

I would also like to thank the troika and the Secretariat for their excellent work.

Our discussions today have confirmed the importance of the UPR process. As we now prepare to further follow up this review, let me again underline that my government very much sees the UPR as part of our national endeavours to ensure systematic human rights work. As I stated earlier, we have accepted a large majority of the recommendations given to Sweden during the Review. We see the recommendations as an important input for our future work related to human rights.

Several other important inquiries and initiatives regarding the future systematic work for human rights in Sweden are ongoing. For example, the Minster for Foreign Affairs announced in February that Sweden will develop a new strategy for human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Swedish Foreign Policy. The work has started and will be conducted in close cooperation with the civil society.

Mr President,

As we did in preparing for the review, we will closely consult civil society and other stakeholders in the follow up. A dialogue with interested parties is essential to ensuring that all relevant issues are covered in an adequate manner.

The follow up will also be a central part of the mandate of our Inter-Ministerial Working Group for Human Rights. As I mentioned in my introduction, as part of the follow up the government will develop a strategy for the systematic work for human rights in Sweden, including proposal for a national institution with the competence to promote and protect human rights in accordance with the Paris Principles.

Sweden will already next year begin preparations for the Swedish mid-term report, scheduled for 2017. We also look forward to continue to engage with this Council ahead of our next review in 2019.

My Government intends to maintain a high level of ambition regarding the implementation of human rights issues on a national level. The UPR process will continue to constitute a vital part of this work.

Thank you, Mr President.

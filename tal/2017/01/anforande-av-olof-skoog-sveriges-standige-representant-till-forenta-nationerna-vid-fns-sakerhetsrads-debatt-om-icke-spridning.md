# Anförande av Olof Skoog, Sveriges ständige representant till Förenta Nationerna, vid FN:s säkerhetsråds debatt om icke-spridning

New York, onsdagen den 18 januari 2017\.
Enligt det talade ordet.

Sweden warmly welcomed the agreement on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in July 2015 as a victory for diplomacy. It is a prime example of peaceful dispute resolution and conflict prevention. Its successful implementation benefits both stability in the region and international peace and security. We call on all parties to fully honour their commitments and to build on the momentum provided by the agreement.

Sweden welcomes the report of the Secretary\-General, which finds that implementation, overall, is on track. We commend the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its compliance with its nuclear related obligations, as evidenced by the reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The fact that there has been no information indicating activities in contravention of restrictions regarding ballistic missile activity and related technology is welcome. It is also promising that the procurement channel process is working, in line with the agreement.

Despite the generally positive picture regarding implementation, a number of areas for concern remain.

Firstly, we are concerned with reports of arms transfers, alleged to have originated in Iran, having taken place. All supply, sale or transfer of arms or related materials from Iran must be authorised on a case\-by\-case basis by the Security Council.

Secondly, there have been reported contraventions of the travel ban. Only the Security Council can determine when such travel is justified. And, all countries must meet their obligations to prevent entry and transit through their territories of individuals on the list maintained pursuant to resolution 2231\.

Sweden calls on the government of Iran to formally respond to the reports of activities undertaken contrary to the provisions of annex B to resolution 2231 identified in the Secretary\-General's report. We stress the importance of the Secretary\-General receiving all the necessary information, including the opportunity to examine specific seizures of arms suspected to have originated in Iran. A close dialogue between Iran and the Secretary\-General, as well as between Iran and the Facilitator, is instrumental in this regard.

A crucial confidence building measure would be early ratification by Iran of the Additional Protocol.

Colleagues,

This historic agreement is one of the major diplomatic achievements of the last decade. Successful implementation requires a long term commitment from all parties. This should be based on mutual trust and respect. We must all work towards that end.

# Global Supply Chains -Public Sector Engagement with CSR

The Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swedish International Development Agency have commissioned research on ways bilateral donors of developed countries can promote corporate social responsibility in global supply chains in developing countries.

This report investigates and evaluates the case for donor intervention; identifies some best practice efforts of bilateral donors; and finally presents strategic proposals for ways bilateral donor agencies and other developed country government agencies can support achievement of these goals.

# Global Public Goods Global Commons

The creation of property rights and the delineation of
territories and national boundaries have made it possible
for private actors or nations to lay claim to significant
parts of the Earth. Global commons are the resource domains that do not fall within the (exclusive)
jurisdiction of any one government.
For these resources, such as fisheries, consumption by one state depletes the resources, leaving less for others. But
they are fundamentally alike once opportunities for
nationalization, private ownership or other restrictions on
access have been exhausted.

This is the second expert paper of the International Task Force on Global Public Goods.

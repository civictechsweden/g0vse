# What do we know about Corporate Social Responsibility?

In November 2005 the Swedish Partnership for Global Responsibility invited a number of researchers from different disciplines to a one\-day workshop at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The purpose of the meeting was to try to get an overview of Swedish research in the field and to stimulate a dialogue between researchers.

The result was a highly rewarding day with presentations of the researchers and their work, both completed and pending, an exchange of experiences in the field and the identification of vital questions. The versatility of the researchers within the group showed how many different approaches there are to CSR.

This report is a presentation of some of the questions that were raised and discussed at the meeting. We would like to thank the participating researchers for their contributions, their engagement at the event and the presentations of their research included in this report.

# Consumer-oriented housing policy instruments. Examples from eight European countries - på engelska

During its EU Presidency, Sweden organised a seminar for Focal Points in Stockholm in October 2009 on the topic of consumer-oriented housing policy instruments. The choice of topic was primarily motivated by the shift in housing policy away from production subsidies made by many countries, including Sweden, in recent decades. Eight Member States held presentations at the meeting.

The aim of this report is limited to transferring knowledge between the Member States. Therefore, the report contains neither normative conclusions nor recommendations. The attempts at summarising made in the report reflect its Swedish authors’ perception of the presentations and available statistics and do not represent the position of the Swedish Government in any respect.

# Strategy for development cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina 2006-2010

Landstrategi: Bosnien och Hercegovina 2006\-2010, på engelska

Country strategy: Bosnia and Herzegovina 2006\-2010

The goal of Swedish development assistance is to support Bosnia and Herzegovina´s development plan, the Mid Term Development Strategy (MTDS), which focuses on accession to the EU and the fight against poverty. In order to achieve this goal, and to promote concentration in the Swedish programme, development assistance is to target two main sectors: the building of a sustainable state, and economic development.

The emphasis during the strategy period will be on long\-term programme\-based funding in support of the EU´s stabilisation and association process and the MTDS. Sweden will seek collaboration with bilateral and multilateral donors to facilitate the programming of major interventions and the coordination and harmonisation of development cooperation work. Bosnia and Herzegovina´s ownership will be of crucial importance in the Swedish development cooperation programme. Support will be directed largely at the central and local levels.

The emphasis in the dialogue will be on corruption, which is a major problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

# Strategy for development cooperation with Georgia 2010-2013

The overarching objective of Swedish development cooperation with Georgia is for the country to develop towards a democratic and accountable state, forging closer ties with the EU.

Georgia has carried out extensive political and economic reforms, but is still a young and fragile democracy where many challenges remain. The armed conflict with Russia in 2008 and the global economic crisis have caused severe economic hardship.

Swedish support will concentrate on three sectors: democracy, human rights and gender equality; the environment; and market development. Georgia´s ambition to forge closer ties with the EU has been further strengthened since the conflict with Russia. The choice of sectors is based on Georgia´s wish for deeper cooperation with the EU, the commitment of other donors, experiences of previous cooperation and Sweden´s comparative advantages.

# Strategy for development cooperation with Rwanda 2010-2013

This strategy governs Sweden´s development cooperation with Rwanda for the period 2010\-2013\. The point of departure is Rwanda´s own strategic priorities and poverty reduction strategy, as well as Sweden´s Policy for Global Development and the Government´s three thematic priorities for development cooperation. Rwanda´s role for peace and security in the region is also an important premise for development cooperation. The choice of direction is based on experiences of previous cooperation, Sweden´s comparative advantages and other donors´ commitments. Previous cooperation shows that the country has the capacity to absorb and make use of international development assistance effectively, and the results of Swedish support are generally positive.

The overarching objective for Swedish development cooperation with Rwanda is reduced poverty and improved conditions for sustainable peace and reconciliation, as well as greater respect for human rights. Development cooperation will focus on the sectors democracy and human rights, the environment and natural resources, and market development. In addition, support will be given to strengthen domestic research capacity. Support to the public sector will be supplemented with support to civil society.

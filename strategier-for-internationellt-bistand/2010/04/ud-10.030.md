# Strategy for selective cooperation with Botswana 2009-2013

This strategy sets out the direction of Sweden´s selective cooperation with Botswana for the period up until the end of 2013.

Since gaining independence in 1966, Botswana has been a stable democracy with a multiparty system and regular general and free elections. Extensive constitutional protection of civil rights and freedoms, an independent judicial system and effective civilian control over the armed forces help make Botswana one of the countries leading the way in Africa. The economic growth rate has been consistently high since independence and the country has developed into a middle-income country with extensive modernisation and improved living standards, both economically and socially, for a large part of the population. However, poverty is widespread and disparities in income in the country remain high. The effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic have a severe impact on the country´s most vulnerable groups and there is a risk of the epidemic undermining the economic progress that has been made.

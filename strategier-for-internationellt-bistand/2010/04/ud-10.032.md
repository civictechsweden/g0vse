# Strategy for selective cooperation with Namibia 2009-2013

This cooperation strategy sets out the direction of SwedenÂ´s selective cooperation with Namibia for the period up until the end of 2013.

Namibia is a democracy characterised by an independent legal system and extensive constitutional protection of civil rights and freedoms. The SWAPO party has been in government since the country became independent in 1990. Some divisions have arisen and new parties have been formed. There is scope for civil society organisations to take on a greater role in proposing ideas and scrutinising those in power. Although they are relatively strong, only a few organisations are active in the area of democracy and human rights. The media are relatively free and the Namibian press vouches for the free, independent scrutiny
of society.

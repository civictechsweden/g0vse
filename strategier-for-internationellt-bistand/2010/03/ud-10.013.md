# Phase-out strategy for Swedish support to Honduras January 2008 - December 2011

Swedish development cooperation with Honduras is to be phased out over the period 2008-2011. Sweden will continue to be an active development partner for Honduras during the entire phase-out period.

The overall objective for SwedenÂ´s development cooperation with Honduras over the period 2008-2011 is improved democratic governance including extended recognition and application of human rights, and better living conditions for women, men, girls and boys living in poverty in rural areas. Sweden will apply a rights perspective and integrate the perspective of poor women, men, girls and boys on development.

# Strategy for selective cooperation with China 2009-2013

The strategy will govern Sweden´s selective cooperation with China during the period 2009\-2013\. The point of departure for the cooperation will be Sweden´s Policy for Global Development, the Swedish Government´s policy for international development cooperation, China´s Five Year Plan, experience from previous development cooperation, the mutual interests of Swedish and Chinese partners, and Sweden´s comparative advantages.

The overall objective of Sweden´s selective cooperation with China is enhanced democratic governance and greater respect for human rights, and environmentally and climate friendly sustainable development. The most important form of cooperation will be partner\-driven cooperation between Swedish and Chinese partners.

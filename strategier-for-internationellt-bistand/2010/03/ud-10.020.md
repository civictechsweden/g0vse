# Strategy for development cooperation with Indonesia 2009-2013

This strategy will govern Sweden's so-called "selective cooperation" with Indonesia for the period 2009-2013. The starting point for cooperation is Sweden's policy for global development, the Swedish Government's policy for international development cooperation, Indonesia's
development plan, experience from previous development cooperation, the expertise, experience and interests of Swedish actors, and the EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy.

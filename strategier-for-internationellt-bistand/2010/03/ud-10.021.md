# Strategy for development cooperation with Timor Leste 2009-2011

This strategy will govern Swedish development cooperation with Timor Leste in 2009-2011 and is based on SwedenÂ´s policy for global development and its international development cooperation policy.

The overall objective of Swedish development cooperation with Timor Leste is to reduce poverty, strengthen peace and stability and promote greater respect for human rights. To minimise the risk of a return to armed conflict, development cooperation will focus on two areas of cooperation that are important for more long-term state-building: 1) democracy and human rights, and 2) education. Although the situation in Timor Leste is slowly improving, the risk of fresh disturbances is considerable and development needs are extensive.

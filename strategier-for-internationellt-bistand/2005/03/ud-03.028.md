Country strategy: Colombia 2003\-2007
The country analysis shows that the escalating internal armed conflict in Colombia poses a serious general obstacle to development in Colombia. The unequal distribution of political and economic power, increasing poverty, weak democratic institutions, widespread impunity, crimes against human rights and international humanitarian law, the unequal distribution of land, and drug trafficking are obstacles to development that are linked to and mutually reinforce one another. They must be addressed to make it possible to achieve sustainable peaceful development in Colombia and regional stability.

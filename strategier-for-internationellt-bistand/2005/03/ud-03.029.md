Country strategy: Bolivia 2003\-2007

Bolivia is the poorest country in South America by all measures, as well as being one of the countries in Latin America and thus in the world with the most unequal distribution of income, resources and power. The indigenous peoples who make up the majority of Bolivias population suffer more from the unequal distribution of resources than whites and mestizos. There is also great inequality in the relations between women and men and between children and adults.15 years of economic and institutional reforms and almost two decades of democratic government have helped to stabilize the economy and improve the social indicators, but they have not helped to appreciably reduce income poverty or inequality. One of the basic problems is that the country has not achieved the necessary level of growth. Bolivia is in great need of a growth rate that generates more jobs, but also of a policy that makes a noticeable impact on resource distribution.

# Strategy for development cooperation with Sri Lanka July 2008 - December 2010

Development cooperation with Sri Lanka is to be phased out in accordance with the Government's decision to focus bilateral development cooperation on certain countries. During the phase\-out stage cooperation will focus on consolidating the results that have already been achieved and on ensuring their sustainability.

The overarching objective of Sweden's development cooperation with Sri Lanka is to improve the conditions for achieving a long\-term sustainable solution to Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict \- a solution based on equal rights for all citizens.

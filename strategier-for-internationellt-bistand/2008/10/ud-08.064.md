# Phase-out strategy for Swedish support to Nicaragua June 2008 - December 2011

Swedish development cooperation with Nicaragua is to be phased out over the period 2008-2011. Sweden will continue to be an active development partner for Nicaragua during the entire phase-out period.
The overall objective for Sweden's development cooperation with Nicaragua over the period 2008-2011 is to create better living conditions for women, men, girls and boys living in poverty by improving democratic governance, strengthening rights with regard to security, justice and health, and providing sustainable opportunities for people to earn a livelihood in rural areas.

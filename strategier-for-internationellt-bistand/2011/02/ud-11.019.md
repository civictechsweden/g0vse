# Strategy for development cooperation with the Republic of Moldova January 2011-December 2014

The overall objective of Swedish development cooperation with Moldova in the longer term is for Moldova to be well integrated with the EU, including the values of the Union.
Implementation of the cooperation strategy will focus on the objective of achieving closer relations with the EU, in line with the Eastern Partnership. Priority in all sectors will be given to contributions relevant to the areas emphasised in Moldova’s national development plan, the country’s action plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) or the equivalent, and associated progress reports.

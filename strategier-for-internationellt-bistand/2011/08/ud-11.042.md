# Cooperation Strategy for Regional Development Cooperation with Sub-Saharan Africa 2010-2015

The present strategy is intended to govern Swedish regional development cooperation with sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2010–2015. Cooperation will take place mainly in relation to the African Union (AU), the Regional Economic Communities (RECs1) and other bodies with a mandate to promote development and security-enhancing regional cooperation in Africa. The strategy is based on Sweden´s Policy for Global Development and the Government Communication on Africa (skr. 2007/08:67). Strategic choices have been made on the basis of analyses of development in the region, experiences and results assessments of previous development cooperation, other donors´ contribution portfolios and commitments, and Sweden´s thematic priorities and comparative advantages.

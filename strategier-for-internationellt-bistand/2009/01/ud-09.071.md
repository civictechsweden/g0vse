# Country strategy: Serbia 2009-2012

The objective of Sweden´s development cooperation with Serbia is to strengthen democracy and promote sustainable development in a way that improves the prospects for membership in the European Union (EU).

Swedish support for Serbia will encourage reforms required for future EU membership by means of initiatives that take account of the Swedish Government´s objectives for reform cooperation in Eastern Europe and Sweden´s thematic
priorities.

Since 2000, Serbia has experienced major changes while its development has been inhibited by recurring political instability. Economic development has been relatively strong. However, extensive reform work is still needed in order to strengthen the economy, democracy and human rights. Extensive reform work is called for in the environmental area as well. An ongoing effort is required if Serbia is to become a modern democratic state characterised by sustainable development based on the EU´s fundamental values.

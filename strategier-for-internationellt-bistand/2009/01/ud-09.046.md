Country strategy: Kenya 2009\-2013

The overarching goal of Swedish development cooperation with Kenya is a Kenya in which all poor people have the opportunity to improve their living conditions, and where their human rights are realised.

The overall strategic dialogue issues are: economic growth, just and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, a rights perspective in policymaking and policy implementation, the fight against corruption, and implementation of vital reforms to address the historical obstacles to development that lay at the root of the violent outbreaks at the beginning of 2008\.

Development cooperation with Kenya will be focused on the following sectors: democratic governance and human rights, natural resources and the environment, and urban development. Aid will be provided for implementation of key reform programmes and support will at the same
time be extended to civil society in order to generate pressure for their implementation.

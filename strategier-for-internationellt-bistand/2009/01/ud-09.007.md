Strategy for development cooperation with Liberia, 2008\-2013

After 14 years of armed conflict Liberia’s peace agreement was signed in 2003\. The agreement laid the foundation for democratic elections in 2005\. The government is facing major challenges in the coming years as the fragile peace has to be strengthened, the country rebuilt and the country´s poverty reduction strategy put into effect.

To avoid reverting to conflict Liberia needs speedy and effective support to establish a more inclusive and democratic political administration and to stimulate growth, thereby increasing the opportunities of earning a livelihood available to a young population suffering from shortages in most areas. A population whose rights,
capacity and energy must be mobilised, developed and channelled into the peaceful and democratic development of the country. Sweden will therefore provide support to the cooperation areas of democratic governance and human rights and agricultural development and business, including regional and international trade.

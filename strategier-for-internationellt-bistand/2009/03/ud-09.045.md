# Strategy for development cooperation with Sierra Leone, 2009-2013

The present strategy governs Swedish development cooperation with Sierra Leone. The strategy is based on Sierra Leone’s own poverty reduction strategy (PRS) and on the priorities identified in the Peace Building Cooperation Framework (PBCF) for Sierra Leone drawn up by the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). In addition, it is based on Sweden's Policy for Global Development (PGU), the overall objective of Swedish international development cooperation, the Swedish Government’s three thematic development cooperation priorities: gender equality and the role of women in development; democracy and human rights; and environment and climate. The strategy is to be informed by a conflict prevention perspective and special consideration is to be given to the rights of children, girls and women. All support will be based on the principle of promoting stability, peace and security, be guided by an awareness of the risk of conflict, and be conflict-sensitive. The regional perspective is to be taken into consideration in this connection.

# Strategy for development cooperation with Vietnam: 2009-2013

During the strategy period, SwedenÂ´s regular development cooperation with Vietnam is to be phased out via a selective cooperation. The overall goal of both the phase\-out and the selective cooperation is enhanced democratic governance, greater respect for human rights and environmentally sustainable development. Key areas of cooperation during the strategy period, therefore, are human rights and democracy, and environment and climate change.

# Strategy for selective cooperation with India 2009-2013

This strategy will govern Sweden's selective cooperation with India during the period 2009-2013. The point of departure for cooperation will be Sweden's Policy for Global Development, the objective of Sweden's development cooperation, India's five-year plans, experience of previous development cooperation and Sweden's comparative advantages.

The overall objective of Sweden's selective cooperation with India is to achieve socially, economically and environmentally sustainable development. The most important form of cooperation during the period will be partner driven cooperation in order to attain self-supporting relationships between Swedish and Indian actors.

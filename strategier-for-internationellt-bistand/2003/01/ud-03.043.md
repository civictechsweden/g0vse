Country strategy: Ethiopia 2003\-2007

Although Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest and least developed countries, the prospects for the development of its resources are good. It also boasts a cultural heritage few other countries can rival. Certain democratic and economic reforms were implemented in the 1990s and decentralisation is high on the agenda. But despite the reforms poverty is deeply rooted and widespread. The private sector is beset by difficulties, direct foreign investment is limited and individuals and local communities still have little or no say in the decisions affecting them. The conclusions of the country analysis may be summed up as follows: there are immense difficulties and problems to be overcome in almost every sector of development assistance and cooperation.

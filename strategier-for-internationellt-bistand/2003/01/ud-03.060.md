Country strategy: Somalia 2003-2005
Development assistance to Somalia is based on a combination of humanitarian assistance and support for reconstruction. The humanitarian assistance is aimed at mitigating the effects of the humanitarian disaster which overtook Somalia following the collapse of the government in 1991. The reconstruction programmes are designed to lend support to the regional and local peaceful political structures which have grown up and to contribute to poverty reduction efforts in the country in the medium term. It is felt that this combination provides the most effective assistance possible.

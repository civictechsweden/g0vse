# Results strategy for Sweden’s international aid in Cambodia 2014 – 2018

The aim is to improve the conditions for democratic development in Cambodia, improve the opportunities for people living in poverty to contribute to and benefit from economic growth, and increase resilience to climate change. The activities are expected to help achieve sub-objectives 1, 2 and 3 in the Government’s aid policy framework (Government Communication 2013/14:131).

# Result strategy for global action on economically sustainable develoment 2014-2018

This strategy governs the use of funds allocated under appropriation item ‘Global action on economically sustainable development’ in Sida’s appropriation directions for each financial year. The strategy will apply for 2014–2017.

Activities within the strategy are intended to contribute to sustainable economic growth with improved conditions for women and men living in poverty, especially in rural areas, to support themselves. This is to be achieved through contributions that increase their opportunities to participate in, and benefit from, economic growth. Contributions that are important for food security are of particular significance.

Activities are expected to contribute to the achievement of sub-objective 2 in the Government’s aid policy framework (Government Communication 2013/14:131): Better opportunities for people living in poverty to contribute to and benefit from economic growth and obtain a good education.

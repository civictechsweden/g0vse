This strategy governs the use of funds allocated under appropriation item ‘Global action on socially sustainable development’ in Sida’s appropriation directions for each financial year. The strategy will apply for 2014–2017\. Activities within the strategy will aim to contribute to healthier lives and lifestyles, as well as socially sustainable and equitable development, with a particular focus on women and children living in poverty. This is to be achieved, for example, through reduced maternal and child mortality rates, better access to water, sanitation, and nutritious food, as well as improved access to learning and good\-quality education.

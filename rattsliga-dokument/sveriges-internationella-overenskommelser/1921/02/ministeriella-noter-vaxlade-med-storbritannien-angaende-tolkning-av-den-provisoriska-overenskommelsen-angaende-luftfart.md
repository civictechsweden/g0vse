# Ministeriella noter, växlade med Storbritannien angående tolkning av den provisoriska överenskommelsen angående luftfart

Sir,
In connection with the signing of the temporary agreement re- garding air navigation of to-day’s date, I would like to place it on record that, as agreed between us, nothing in the terms of artides 2 and 10 of the agreement shall be interpreted as restricting the freedom of the competent Swedish authorities, skould they wish to extend to some Swedish aviators the privilege of using some of the few military aero- dromes in Sweden not open to public use, and therefore closed to ali foreign aviators.

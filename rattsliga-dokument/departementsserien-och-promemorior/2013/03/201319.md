# Future Challenges for Sweden â€“ Final Report of the Commission on the Future of Sweden

This book sets out the Commission's final report. Particular attention is focused on challenges relating to sustainable growth, demographic development, labour market integration, democracy, gender equality and social cohesion. However, the report is far from exhaustive. It does not offer proposals on how future challenges are to be met. Indeed, this was not its aim. Rather it identifies a series of challenges that Sweden may in due course be confronted with. It may therefore be seen as an important step in the ongoing work of shaping a policy for a future Sweden.

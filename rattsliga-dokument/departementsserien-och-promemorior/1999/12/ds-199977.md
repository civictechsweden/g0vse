# Swedish Blood Plasma Self-Sufficiency in a European Context

As shown in annual reviews by the National Swedish Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden has been self\-sufficient in blood plasma since 1990\. This investigation, which involved extensive collaboration with a range of interested parties, however, confirms that Sweden is facing a substantial risk that certain aspects of plasma collection will be discontinued due to price competition, primarily from the United States. Other European countries face a similar situation.

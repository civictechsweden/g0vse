# Government Communication 2005/06:204 Sweden's Global Development Policy

Progress in work on SwedenÂ´s global development policy is reported to the Swedish Riksdag each year in a Government Communication.
One key aim of this policy is to establish coherence between individual policy areas
so that they all work towards the overall goal of equitable and sustainable global development.
The Government Communication for 2006 focuses on work in five priority areas:
environmental policy, agriculture policy, trade policy, migration policy and security policy.

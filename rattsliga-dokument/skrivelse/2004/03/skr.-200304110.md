# Policies for Democracy

Engelsk version av regeringens skrivelse Demokratipolitik. Skrivelsen innehåller en redovisning och analys av den svenska demokratins utveckling efter 2002 i förhållande till målen för att värna och fördjupa den svenska folkstyrelsen. I skrivelsen presenteras också demokratipolitikens fortsatta inriktning.

The Government communication is divided into two principal sections:

The first part, (Chapters 2\-7\) presents a detailed account and analysis of the development of Swedish democracy from 2002 in light of goals established as part of a national strategy for safeguarding and deepening Swedish democracy. It also includes a report of actions taken. Where the outcome of these measures is already known, the extent to which they have contributed to long\-term efforts to achieve these goals is discussed.

The second part (Chapters 8\-12\) concerns the future direction of the Government's democracy policies. Its concluding assessment is that future policies should incorporate initiatives designed to encourage greater, more broadly\-based public participation on the one hand, and action aimed at promoting human rights on the other. The communication also sets out the Government's policy aims with regard to participation. These presuppose efforts to remove hindrances to \- while strengthening conditions and generating opportunities for \- greater, more equal participation.

The Government plans to implement measures aimed at highlighting and removing structural obstacles that serve to hinder individuals from accessing power and exercising political influence. The Government will also take steps to counter threats to democracy, e.g. in the form of threats or violence directed at elected political representatives. Other measures to improve conditions for representatives will also be introduced.

The Government intends to further emphasise the importance of participation between elections and the need to view citizen involvement from a civil rights perspective. It will also clearly define the significance of the creation of an additional level at which to exercise political influence following Sweden's accession to the European Union.

# The Rights of the Child as a Perspective in Development Cooperation

The Swedish Government submits, in this communication, an account of the experience gained from Swedish and international efforts to make development cooperation conducive to realisation of the rights of every child as upheld in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The communication provides a forward-looking presentation of how the Swedish Government intends to apply this experience and other new knowledge in strategic considerations and priority measures to contribute, through Swedens international development cooperation, to attainment of the joint International Development Goals.
In this communication, the Swedish Government presents a ten-point programme intended to serve as a guide to further integration of the child-rights perspective into development cooperation. Four strategic areas of work to promote respect for the rights of the child are emphasised: social reform, healthcare, education for all and action for disadvantaged children. With this communication, the overview of childrights issues carried out by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is complete.

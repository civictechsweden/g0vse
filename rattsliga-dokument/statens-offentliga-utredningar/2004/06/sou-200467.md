# Nuclear Waste, State-of-the-art Report 2004

Since the Swedish National Council for Nuclear Waste (KASAM) was established in 1985, KASAM has regularly published reports of its independent review of the state\-of\-the\-art in the nuclear waste area.

None of KASAM's state\-of\-the\-art reports can provide an entirely comprehensive view of the state\-of\-the\-art in the nuclear waste area. This is not KASAM's aim. Instead, each report deals with current issues in the debate at the time of publication and for which there may be a need to present an accurate and accessible overview. The choice of subject areas covered is also, to some extent, affected by the competence profiles of KASAM's members. A detailed description of the structure of this state\-of\-the\-art report is provided in an introduction.

The main contents of the report:

Section I \- The Nuclear Waste Issue in Sweden and Abroad
Section II \- Handling the Risks of Nuclear Waste. An Overview of Methods, Problems and Possibilities
Section III \- The Nuclear Waste Issue and the Future
